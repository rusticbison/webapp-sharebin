## Welcome to shareb.in

Companies all over the world have their share registration data stored in centralized, inaccessible databases. Until now, these expensive data registration schemes were accessible only to those lucky enough to have been born in a wealthy country that provides such infrastructure. Approximately 80% of the people on this planet cannot access these basic data registration schemes, which means that the playing field today is very unequal. 

shareb.in helps level the playing field. With shareb.in, you can issue your company's common stock on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain is the only computer in the world that has perfect availability, is completely open and accessible to everyone, and is completely tamperproof. 

shareb.in is an open service that lets any company, from an entrepreneur in Côte d’Ivoire to a Swiss multinational, use common infrastructure to prove to the world that their shares were registered properly. Using shareb.in, investors can refer to the company's original registration artifact in the even of a dispute over number of shares issued, or the date of issue.

### What's the problem?

When a company creates shares, where is the record of that event stored? Can investors prove that the original records have never been tampered with?

There are 195 countries offering different schemes for share registration, and each comes with it's own unique rules and costs. This in part causes global investment to be distributed unequally, and perhaps unfairly.
