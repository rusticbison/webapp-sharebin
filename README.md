## Welcome to shareb.in 

List your company's common stock on the blockchain today. 
100% availability and open access for investors and regulators anywhere in the world.

### What's the problem?

When a company creates shares, where is the record of that event stored? Can investors prove that the original records have never been tampered with? In most cases, the answer is unfortunately "no". 

There are 195 countries, and many offer a proprietary scheme for share registration. Each comes with it's own unique rules and costs, leading to a "sharded" global business environment. This in part causes global investment to be distributed unequally, and perhaps unfairly.

### What does shareb.in do to help?

shareb.in is an open service that lets any business, from an solo entrepreneur in Côte d’Ivoire to a Swiss multinational, use common infrastructure to prove to the world that their shares were registered properly and in a globally acceptable format. 

With shareb.in you register your company’s common stock using the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain is the only database in the world that has perfect availability, is completely open and accessible to everyone, and is completely tamperproof. Using shareb.in, investors can refer to the company’s original registration artifact in the event of a dispute over number of shares issued or the date of issue. The registration artifact cannot be modified and lasts forever. 


### This service is coming soon

This service will be available April 1, 2017.
